# Benefits
## When you write stories for components, you get a bunch of additional benefits for free.

#### 📝 Develop UIs that are more durable
Isolate components and pages and track their use cases as stories. Verify hard-to-reach edge cases of UI. Use addons to mock everything a component needs—context, API requests, device features, etc.

#### ✅ Test UIs with less effort and no flakes
Stories are a pragmatic, reproducible way of tracking UI states. Use them to spot-test the UI during development. Storybook offers built-in workflows for automated Accessibility, Interaction, and Visual testing. Or use stories as test cases by importing them into other JavaScript testing tools.

#### 📚 Document UI for your team to reuse
Storybook is the single source of truth for your UI. Stories index all your components and their various states, making it easy for your team to find and reuse existing UI patterns. Storybook also auto-generates documentation from those stories.

#### 📤 Share how the UI actually works
Stories show how UIs actually work, not just a picture of how they're supposed to work. That keeps everyone aligned on what's currently in production. Publish Storybook to get sign-off from teammates. Or embed them in wikis, Markdown, and Figma to streamline collaboration.

#### 🚦Automate UI workflows
Storybook is compatible with your continuous integration workflow. Add it as a CI step to automate user interface testing, review implementation with teammates, and get signoff from stakeholders.
